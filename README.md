# Personal Website
This is a personal website I created to familiarize myself with the Django python framework. This website was deployed using Heroku. 

## Description
This iteration of my personal portfolio website contains projects that I had completed up until November 2022 as well as a video gallery including concerts/recitals I have given as a cello performance major.
By making this website, I gained valuable experience learning a new framework from scratch. This experience has aided me in learning the many frameworks I have encountered since then by exposing me to basic data management and front-end development.
